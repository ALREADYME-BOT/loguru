About Loguru:

This simple logger is a simple logging system with little to no optional configuration. 
When used as a system logger, it provides two reading/write interfaces. Attributes for each IO connection are implemented in each thread of the developing process. In addition, timestamps can be stored in place in each server.

Python version: 1.8.3


Now you don't need to type URL linked to logiruutelottot, which is in the.log file. Post-cache and connections made after the proccess restart are automatically available. 

Logging options:

-2: Text file operation Open in a terminal
-3: Log file creation Delete and remove via file system
-4: Log file route Resharper / put log file in a new stream

Usage:

    loguru = '@loguru[path]'
        ...
        loguru = '/path/to/logiru.txt'

        ...

    should_catch(err):
        msg = "... err: {}...".format(unrepr(err))

    msg = "... logger created..."
    print(msg, progress_report=False)
    msg = "... logger created"
    print(msg, progress_report = True)

    msg = "... no errors"

    msg = "... logger created"

    # loguru = '/path/to/wpconfig.log'
    # msg = "... blog header: 'wpconfig.log'::log".format(loguru)
    # msg = "... no errors".format(loguru)

    # should_catch(msg): msg = "... no errors"

## Configurations:

If you don't want to use a log file, you can create one yourself. If you don't have your choice, simply configure your own logger stub. Loguru provides support for both upstream logging sticklers and also backend compatible services such as Apache Flux, Varnish and Nginx. It also provides the interface you need to configure Apache Hooks.

Look at both the class diagrams and statics. This version has been mostly repaired so that it runs like it's supposed to.
